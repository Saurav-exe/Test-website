        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em> technologies: <em>HTML, CSS</em>, and
        <em>JavaScript</em>. These are the languages of the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.
        It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe
        the content of a webpage (not a programming language). HTML consists of
        elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links,
        headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render
        HTML code as websites.
      </p>

      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of <strong>3 parts</strong>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

      <p>

      </p>

      <h3><u>Why should you learn HTML?</u></h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          WordPress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>
